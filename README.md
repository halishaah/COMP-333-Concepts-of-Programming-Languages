# COMP-333-Concepts-of-Programming-Languages

## Course Description (From the Catalog)
Discussion of issues in the design, implementation and use of high-level programming 
languages through a historical framework, including how languages reflect different 
design philosophies and use requirements and the technical issues in the design of 
main abstraction constructs of programming languages. Other approaches to imperative 
or object-oriented programming, functional programming, logical programming and 
parallel programming.


## Learning Objectives:
Successful students will be able to:
* Understand when to use, and write programs using:
* Execution approaches: compilation, interpretation, and just-in-time (JIT) compilation
* Memory management: garbage collection, reference counting
* Types: dynamic typing, static typing, strong typing, weak typing, untyped
* Parameter passing: call-by-value, call-by-name
* Read context-free grammars, construct abstract syntax trees, and parse programs
*  Write object-oriented programs using:
* Inheritance: class-based, prototype-based
* Virtual dispatch
* Write functional programs using:
* Higher-order functions
* Algebraic data types and pattern matching
* Generics and parametric polymorphism
*  Write logic programs using:
* Unification
* Nondeterminism
* Write parallel programs using Java's parallel streams
